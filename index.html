                              The Atlantic City Expressway uses a barrier toll system, with mainline toll plazas and ramp tolls. As of January 1, 2023, all passenger vehicles currently must pay a $4.55 toll at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza, which is located east of the Farley Service Plaza at milepost 17.5, and a $1.35 toll near Pleasantville. Both mainline toll plazas have Express E-ZPass lanes through the center of the plaza. Tolls are also collected at seven entrances and exits. A $1.35 toll for cars is charged at the eastbound exits and westbound entrances at exits 5, 28, and 33, the westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 12, and all ramps at exit 9; in addition, a $0.70 toll for cars is charged at the eastbound exits and westbound entrances at exits 38 and 41.[13][14] In addition, a $4.55 E-ZPass only toll is charged for the westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 17.[4][15] E-ZPass users who frequently use the road receive a discount on their tolls.[13][14]
                              Every year since 2013, with the exception of 2020 and 2021, eastbound tolls are waived at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza between 5:00 and 6:00 pm on Friday before Memorial Day to promote the unofficial beginning of the summer tourist season at the Jersey Shore. Chickie's & Pete's, a local sports bar chain, pays for the tolls collected during this hour.[16][17] In October 2014, eastbound tolls were waived at the Egg Harbor and Pleasantville toll plazas on Tuesdays between noon and midnight to encourage midweek tourism to Atlantic City.

                              The Atlantic City Expressway, officially numbered, but unsigned, as Route 446 and abbreviated A.C. Expressway, ACE, or ACX, and known locally as the Expressway, is a 44.19-mile (71.12 km) long toll road in the U.S. state of New Jersey, managed and operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA).

                              The Garden State Parkway (GSP) is a controlled-access toll road that stretches the northâ€“south length of eastern New Jersey from the state's southernmost tip near Cape May north to the New York state line at Montvale. Its name refers to New Jersey's nickname, the "Garden State". 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The Garden State Parkway uses an open system of tolling in which flat-rate tolls are collected at numerous toll plazas placed along the mainline and at certain interchanges. This contrasts with the New Jersey Turnpike, which uses a closed system in which a motorist receives a ticket with the toll rates at the highway's entrance, and turns in the ticket along with the toll upon exiting at toll gates. Tolls can be paid by using cash or the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system.[74]
                              As of January 1, 2023, the standard car toll is $1.05 for cash and $1.01 for E-ZPass on the main road at two-way toll plazas and $2.10 for cash and $2.02 for E-ZPass at one-way toll plazas. Some entrances and exits require a toll of either $0.75, $1.05, $1.45, or $2.10 for cash and $0.70, $1.01, $1.39, or $2.02 for E-ZPass.[75][76] Additional E-ZPass discounts are available for off-peak travel, senior citizens, drivers of green vehicles, and trailers.[74]

                              Toll revenue collected at each bridge location began as a $0.25 toll for class 1 vehicles (includes passenger cars, pickup trucks and vans). There have been 3 toll rate hikes over the years. The 1st toll rate increase was in 1978, when the complete toll structure was revised. This was done because revenue was not increasing enough to cover construction and maintenance costs. The rate went from $0.25 to $0.30. In 1984 it was determined that there was again a need to cover construction and maintenance costs with existing toll revenue not meeting the needs. The rate went from $0.30 to $0.40. The last time rates were increased was in 1988 when again the costs of construction and maintenance repairs were rising. This toll rate increase went from $0.40 to $0.50.

                              The last bridge to be constructed by the Commission is Corsons Inlet Bridge. The bridge is located in Strathmere and at the south end of Ocean City. An inlet, a short distance from the bridge, feeds from the Atlantic Ocean, but is currently impassable to marine vessels. The back bays are a favorite fishing area.
